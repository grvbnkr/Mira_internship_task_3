A Python Tkinter project enquiry app for subject enquiry using SQLite3 database for database operations and only using the create operation among CRUD operations can be used to create and manage a database of subjects offered by an educational institution. The app can be used by students to enquire about the subjects they are interested in, and by faculty to manage the database of subjects.

The app can be designed with a simple GUI that includes the following components:

A label for the title of the app
A text box for the user to enter the users name
A button to save datails of users to database.
A Radiobutton to select subject.
The app will use the following validation to ensure that the user enters valid data:

The subject name text box must not be empty.
The subject name must be unique.
The app will use SQLite3 to create and manage the database of subjects. The database will have a single table with the following columns:

on main panel above user button admin panal is present.

click it will show admin authentication process for admin
only admin can open admin panel

after passing authentication process admin can see all query's of users

This is just a brief description of how a Python Tkinter project enquiry app for subject enquiry using SQLite3 database for database operations and only using the create operation among CRUD operations can be designed.
